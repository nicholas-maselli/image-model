# Data

Put datasets here. This folder is **git-ignored** to keep the repo small.

Suggested layout:

-   `data/raw/`: original data as obtained (immutable)
-   `data/test_images/`: test images

Tips:

-   Store _how to download/prepare_ data (links + scripts) in `src/scripts/`, not the data itself.
-   If you want versioned data, consider DVC later.
